**Market Manipulation Commands:**
â€¢ \`/spook\` - Once per day, attempt to scare the market
  - 1% chance of success
  - If successful, drops price by ${(SPOOK_CHANGE * 100).toFixed(0)}%
  - Failed attempts still count as your daily try
  - Resets at midnight EST
  
â€¢ \`/pump\` - Once per day, attempt to boost the market

**Game Mechanics:**
â€¢ Prices update every minute
â€¢ Price updates are announced every 30 minutes in #bfcn
â€¢ Price changes follow a normal distribution with:
  - Mean change: 0.5%
  - Maximum change: Â±60%
â€¢ When buying, there's a 15% chance of getting less than you paid for
â€¢ Daily work rewards use a log-normal distribution:
  - Most rewards around ${formatCurrency(0.1)}
  - Range from ${formatCurrency(0.0001)} to ${formatCurrency(100)}

Good luck trading! ðŸ“ˆ
